ATTENTION! THIS PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED! 

As I no longer work with FitNesse/Gradle, and considering a low number of users, I would like to resign from my duty of maintaining this project.

1. Description

- fitnesse-gradle-classpath plugin will let you to use gradle build files to manage dependencies in FitNesse tests

2. How to build

- clone git repository
- invoke gradle build command
- the jar with plugin code will be at build/libs/fitnesse-gradle-classpath.jar

3. How to use

- create plugins.properties file in FitNesse root directory if it does not exist
- add the following line
    SymbolTypes=fitnesse.wikitext.widgets.GradleClasspathSymbolType
- copy fitnesse-gradle-classpath.jar to plugins directory in FitNesse root directory
- start FitNesse as usual
- you should see the following message in FitNesse console
    Custom symbol types loaded:
    		fitnesse.wikitext.widgets.GradleClasspathSymbolType
- now you can add the following tag in FitNesse pages
	!gradle /Users/mclovin/development/resources/fitnesse.gradle@test
- FitNesse page will show information on the source location, scope, all resolved libraries, and any non-resolved dependencies

4. Customization

- plugin is using the following mapping for scopes (@ indicates plugin scope)
    @test(default)
        testCompile
        testRuntime
    @compile
    	compile
    @runtime
    	runtime

5. Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank Arjan Molenaar(https://github.com/amolenaar), whose work on fitnesse-maven-plugin and fitnesse-ivy-plugin inspired me to create
one for Gradle
